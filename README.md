# Peep, a javascript iA Writer-style Markdown WYSIWYG
Meet *peep*, your new friend. Peep is attached to a `contenteditable`, and then allows you to input live and lovely Markdown, which is automatically formatted, but still preserves your initial markdown syntax. It tries to replicate iA Writer's Markdown behavior to the extent *possible* in javascript.

## Dependencies
* jQuery

## Changelog

## Notes
### Current status
Basically, it doesn't work. But hopefully it will.

### Thanks
A big thanks to Stack Overflow's excellent [PageDown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/) javascript markdown parser, from which I have borrowed heavily from in creating Peep.
